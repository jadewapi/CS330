# Computational Graphics and Visualization Project

## Overview

This project is part of my portfolio submission for the Computer Science program. It includes two key components: the **3D Scene ZIP folder** and the **Design Decisions document**. These files showcase my ability to create a fully realized 3D world while reflecting on the design and development processes involved. This reflection highlights the knowledge and skills I gained in computational graphics and visualizations, which are invaluable for my future educational and professional goals.

## Reflection

### How Do I Approach Designing Software?

When designing software, I start by analyzing the problem and identifying the requirements of the project. My work on this project helped me refine my design skills, such as selecting appropriate tools, creating reusable assets, and thinking about user experience in a 3D environment. I followed a systematic design process, beginning with concept sketches, asset modeling, and texture mapping, then integrating these into a cohesive 3D scene. In future projects, these tactics can be applied to streamline workflows, ensure clarity, and maintain a user-centric focus.

### How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

Developing programs requires a combination of strategic planning and adaptability. For this 3D scene, I employed new strategies, such as experimenting with advanced lighting techniques, optimizing object placement, and using iterative testing to improve the final result. Iteration was criticalâ€”each adjustment refined the scene, from texture resolution to lighting balance. Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved to emphasize modular development, allowing me to efficiently adjust components without disrupting the overall project.

### How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?

Computational graphics and visualizations have provided me with skills that are applicable to both my academic and professional pathways. Academically, these skills enhance my ability to work on complex projects involving 3D modeling, simulations, or virtual environments. Professionally, they are critical in fields like game design, virtual reality, and data visualization, where creating immersive and interactive experiences is key. This project not only expanded my technical expertise but also strengthened my problem-solving abilities, which are essential for success in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
